    "# Virtual Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "A virtual environment in Python is an isolated workspace that allows you to manage dependencies for different projects separately. Each virtual environment has its own installation of Python and its own set of installed packages, independent from the global Python installation on your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "This isolation is important because different projects may require different versions of the same library. By using virtual environments, you avoid version conflicts and keep your global Python environment clean.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you might have one project that depends on Django 3.2 and another that uses Django 5.0 — with virtual environments, both can coexist without interfering with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tools like venv, virtualenv, pipenv, or uv make it easy to create and manage these environments."

    "* **Pipfile.lock** – records the exact versions used, ensuring reproducible installs.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "If pipenv doesn't find an environment (by checking the Pipfile) in the active directory a new enviroment will be created.\n",
    "The new environment will create a Pipfile, Pipfile.lock and a virtual environment folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Pipenv will look for a folder named as `.venv` in the active directory, this folder will be used to install the environment. If the active directory does **not** has a folder named as `.venv` the environment will be installed at `~\\.environments`.\n",

    "Poetry uses two main files to manage project dependencies:\n",
    "\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "poetry shell\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "Poetry replaces manual use of pip for dependency management.\n",
    "To install a package, use:\n",
